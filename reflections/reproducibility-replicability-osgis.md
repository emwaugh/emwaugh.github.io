title: Reproducibility & Replicability in Open Source GIS
---

September 27, 2021

Open source GIS is playing an important role in the reproducibility/replicability
realm of science. Besides making tools and data more accessible, I imagine that
accountability increases when it's easier for researchers to check credibility of their peers'
claims, and public trust in geographic research will be enhanced.

Open source GIS shows the data and analysis and certainly contributes to issues
with R&R as long as code is well documented. And therefore, code is essentially
cross-referenced when it is applied to other study areas or in different
contexts, to determine if the initial result was anomalous. It seems as if the
difference between idiographic and nomothetic approaches to geography make it
more of a challenge to quantify replicability, though geographers are discussing
how to incorporate the two together.

Additionally, development of infrastructure in the form of software, guides, and
reporting standards in organizations increase accountability within the field
(Sui & Kedron 2021). It also seems as if the open source GIS community is very
engaged in each others' work, and is driving more collaboration and innovation
in ways to address spatial problems.
Are there other disciplines that are making such a coordinated effort to
maintain the availability of raw data and source code?
(I imagine that computer and data science are experiencing similar demands to
move toward transparency.)

There are some problems with reproducibility and replicability that open source
GIS will not address on its own, however.
I'm not sure that open source has improved precision compared to other methods.
Also, my understanding is that being open source GIS only requires that
*code* is available, and not that other decisions are included--depending on
the types of data being incorporated, I can see where specific
choices in methodology may not be reproducible without very thorough
documentation; for example, there can be a lot of variation in field sampling or
survey procedures that may not necessarily be documented. It seems like these
limitations would be more easily avoided in GIS compared to other sciences, however.
In addition, decisions in organizing and cleaning data can play a big role in
the results (NASEM 2019 Box 3.2), though well documented code should reflect
that.
